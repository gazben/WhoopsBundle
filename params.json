Add this bundle to your project as a composer dependency:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n    // composer.json\r\n    {\r\n        // ...\r\n        require-dev: {\r\n            // ...\r\n            \"mickaelandrieu/whoops-bundle\": \"dev-master\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add this bundle to your application kernel:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n    // app/AppKernel.php\r\n    public function registerBundles()\r\n    {\r\n        // ...\r\n        if (in_array($this->getEnvironment(), array('dev'))) {\r\n            $bundles[] = new Am\\WhoopsBundle\\AmWhoopsBundle();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return $bundles;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThat's all ! Enjoy the new theme we've created for Symfony 2.\r\n\r\nNote: this bundle is compatible with [GnugatWizardBunde](https://github.com/gnugat/GnugatWizardBundle)\r\n\r\n3. Configure Path to the resources for theming (non required)\r\n\r\nYou can as well create your own theme, by create a folder in your application\r\nwith the files you want to override: you will essentialy override the css styles\r\nand need to create a file ```whoops.base.css``` that you need to locate in an css folder.\r\nFor now, ```Whoops``` is still a WIP and you have to follow this to make your own theme.\r\n\r\nYou can override as well all the files loaded by ```Whoops``` library for the ```PrettyPageHandler```\r\nused here:\r\n\r\n* pretty-page.css\r\n* pretty-template.php\r\n\r\nThen, configure the bundle in your ```config.yml``` file:\r\n\r\n    am_whoops:\r\n        resources_path: \"%kernel.root_dir%/../web/bundles/amwhoops\"\r\n\r\n4. How to contribute\r\n\r\nThis bundle is now fully unit-tested, I will accept only PR with tests\r\nrelated to this roadmap:\r\n\r\n* Allow user to create his own Handlers\r\n* Update whoops library to 1.1 when tagged to stable\r\n* Create symfony-whoops-edition to have a demo website\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
